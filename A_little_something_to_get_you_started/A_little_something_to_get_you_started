To Do: 
	
	- Whenever we have any challenges related to WEB, the first thing we do is we have to check the page source 
	- Because, most of developers have this habit of commeting the code.
	- We may also find some sensitive endpoints, try accessing those endpoints and see what the response is.
	- If some path/URL is commented try to access those paths/URL and see what happens.
