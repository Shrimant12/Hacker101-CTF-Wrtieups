Name : Micro-CMS v1/Flag0

Difficulty : Easy

Points : 2 per Flag 

Flags : 4
 
Skills : Web 

Hints : 
    Try creating a new page
    How are pages indexed?
    Look at the sequence of IDs
    If the front door doesn't open, try the window
    In what ways can you retrieve page contents?


To Do : 
	- When we click on first link, we get URL as http://yourlink/path/page/1
	- When we click on edit this page, we get URL as http://yourlink/path/page/edit/1

	- Same happens with second link.

	- When we click on "Create a new page", we get URL as http://yourlink/path/page/13
    - When we edit our created page, we get URL as http://yourlink/path/page/edit/13

    See the page sequence, 
    Pages which are already created have sequence as page/1 and page/2

    Pages which are created by us have sequence starting from page/13 , page/14, page/15 and so on.

    What about page/3 , page/4 , page/5 , page/6 , page/7 ???????

    OKay, So lets try to access those pages directly :) 

    When I access http://yourlink/path/page/4 (or any other) we get NOT FOUND error

    But wait, when we access http://yourlink/path/page/6 we get Forbidden error :) 

    Now think of what path we used to edit the page ??? :P 
    Can we edit page/6 ? If Yes, Do it right away...
